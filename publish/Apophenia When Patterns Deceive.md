# Apophenia: When Patterns Deceive

You’re walking through the forest, spear in hand. It’s a dark night, and the sun has been down for several hours. The cold bites at your skin, and the silence is unsettling. Tasked with bringing food back to your tribe, you creep deeper into the dense trees, moving as silently as the brush-covered forest floor allows. Suddenly, you hear a low growl and rustling in a nearby bush. Whatever it is, it’s big. This isn’t just the wind. It’s large and seems to be responding to your movements. You realize you are no longer the hunter but the prey. Aware of the danger, you wait for the right moment, then turn and flee, running as fast as you can in the opposite direction. You live to see another day.

The human proclivity toward pareidolia—or more broadly, apophenia—is a fundamental part of our experience. Apophenia is defined as “the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things.” This ability is deeply embedded in our very programming. Our capacity to identify patterns is undoubtedly an evolutionary marvel, but it’s also a flawed one.

Our ability to recognize patterns and assign them meaning is an evolutionary trait that served as an invaluable survival tool. Our ancestors lived in a world where danger lurked behind every tree, rock, and bush. Whether it was a predator hunting for its next meal or an unseen threat ready to strike, death was always close at hand. The ability to quickly assess sensory information and detect patterns in the environment could make the difference between life and death. However, this pattern recognition isn’t necessarily about detecting truth; it’s about ensuring survival. It doesn’t matter if there is an actual predator in the brush—we are just as likely to survive if we think there is and avoid it.

At first glance, this may seem like a minor distinction, but it has significant implications. In addition to our pattern-detection skills, humans are also rational beings who dislike being wrong. So when we experience pareidolia—detecting a pattern that isn’t necessarily rational—we often attribute extraordinary causes to justify our belief in its meaningful connection. This can manifest as assigning divine or spiritual significance to everyday coincidences simply because we are unwilling to admit that our pattern-detection software may be flawed.

In fact, one might argue that this tendency is not just a cause but *the* cause of religion as a whole. It’s no coincidence that every isolated group of people on Earth has developed some form of independent spiritual or religious belief. Imagine a tribal village being devastated by a snowstorm. Several members die, buildings are destroyed, yet one structure remains—their food store. Can we fault this tribe for concluding that this event, which could mean the difference between life and starvation, is more than mere coincidence? Surely, they must find meaning and purpose in such an event. Perhaps it was a divine being protecting them, the spirit of the storm itself, or their long-past ancestors offering aid from another realm. And thus, religion is born.

Our proclivity to attribute meaning to our experiences is powerful, and it’s something we should be critical of. If you’ve ever taken an IQ test, you know how significant this can be. Many IQ test questions involve pattern recognition, whether in the form of number sequences or picture patterns. It would seem that the ability to identify patterns, and then to rule them out as flawed, is a significant predictor of intelligence. It’s not just about recognizing a pattern but also being able to analyze, acknowledge when we are wrong, and find a better solution.

Thomas Edison is often quoted as saying he learned a hundred ways not to make a lightbulb before finding the one way that worked. Perhaps the lesson we can learn from pareidolia is that while it is a powerful tool, it’s one we should approach critically. Ultimately, it’s far better to be wrong and learn from it than to be accidentally right. That is, of course, unless you think there’s a tiger in the bush—in that case, just run.
